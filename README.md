# Project_Portfolio
Simple Overview of List of Projects.

## Gesture Controlled Virtual Mouse & Voice Automation
* The system employs Machine Learning and Computer Vision algorithms to recognize static and dynamic hand gestures and
voice commands, without the need for additional hardware. The system leverages models such as Convolutional Neural
Networks implemented by MediaPipe running on top of py-bind11.

## Web Development - College Course Registration Portal
* Front-end and Back-end enabled Online Portal for registration of academic coursework, inclusive of both Student and Faculty
functionalities.

## Android Application Development - AI Chess Game
* An AI based chess app written in Flutter using Flame engine, using the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning with
difficulty levels ranging from 1-6 along with functionality supporting different visual thematic graphics.

## ML - Multi-Modal Emotion Recognition Using Speech
* Project involved in building a Speech Emotion Recognition system that records human speech tone using Scikit-learn
library in Python and train/test a suited machine learning ( as well as deep learning ) algorithm (selecting the modal as per
user input or on basis of efficiency) that could recognize and detect human emotions from speech.

## Internet Of Things - HealthCare Monitor System
* IOT based smart health monitoring system, serves as track and alert device by sensing heart rate, spo2 and temperature
and sending distress signals in case of any severe conditions or emergencies.

## ML Stock Market Prediction
* A comprehensive machine learning project for stock market prediction is undertaken, encompassing data analysis, visualization, technical analysis, regression for fundamental analysis, classification for trade call predictions, and clustering for diversification analysis. The goal is to create a tool for informed stock market investment decisions.

## Customer Churn Prediction
* This project involves development of a machine learning model that predicts customer churn for Sunbase, a company that values customer satisfaction. The goal is to create a model that can identify customers who are likely to churn, helping the company take
proactive measures to retain them. It consists of a step-by-step approach, starting from data preprocessing and culminating in model deployment.
