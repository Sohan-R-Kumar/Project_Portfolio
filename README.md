## Gesture Controlled Virtual Mouse & Voice Automation
* The system employs Machine Learning and Computer Vision algorithms to recognize static and dynamic hand gestures and
voice commands, without the need for additional hardware. The system leverages models such as Convolutional Neural
Networks implemented by MediaPipe running on top of pybind11.
